# Point of Rental Analytics

This repository is the operational home for the Point of Rental analytics stack:

- `semantic/lightdash/` contains the semantic layer, charts, and dashboards for a pure Lightdash YAML project.
- `apps/analytics-suite/` is the retained analytics application surface.
- `apps/docs-site/` is the retained planning and architecture documentation app.
- `apps/changelog/` is a Docusaurus site published on Vercel for the public-facing analytics changelog.
- `apps/changelog/tooling/` contains changelog-owned automation logic.
- `semantic/lightdash/tooling/` contains Lightdash-owned validation logic.
- `tooling/src/lib/` contains shared Python support code reused by those domain tools.

The current architecture is intentionally dbt-free. Lightdash metadata lives in standalone YAML so the BI layer can move quickly without coupling business logic to dbt project structure. When dbt is introduced, the semantic layer standards in this repo are designed to migrate cleanly into dbt `meta:` blocks.

## Principles

- Treat the semantic layer as production software, not dashboard glue.
- Optimize for both human self-serve analysis and agentic query generation.
- Keep business definitions explicit, versioned, reviewed, and documented.
- Automate review, deployment, and changelog hygiene in CI.

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
cd tooling && uv sync
pnpm validate
pnpm changelog:dev
```

Useful commands:

- `pnpm lightdash:lint` validates Lightdash YAML.
- `pnpm changelog:build` builds the Docusaurus changelog site.
- `pnpm skills:check` validates the local mandatory skill installs against `skills.manifest.json`.

## CI/CD

- `ci.yml` enforces formatting, Markdown quality, Python type checking, linting, and tests, and site build integrity.
- `lightdash-deploy.yml` deploys Lightdash metadata and content on merge to `main`.
- `vercel-deploy.yml` deploys `analytics-suite`, `docs-site`, and `changelog` to their Vercel production projects after `CI` succeeds on `main`.
- `codex-changelog.yml` generates a changelog entry from merged PR metadata and commits it back to `main`.
